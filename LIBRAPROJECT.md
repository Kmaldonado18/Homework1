# The Future of Global Financial Services: Cryptocurrency and the Blockchain
----

## __OVERVIEW AND ORIGIN OF THE LIBRA PROJECT__
  

__*FACEBOOK'S LIBRA PROJECT:*__

- Projected with a first-half of __2020 release date__; The Libra Project aspires to provide a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of individuals.

* Who are the founders of the company project?

    * Facebook teams served a leadership role throughout 2019, to help create and launch the concept of a global cryptocurrency called the Libra, as well as The Libra Blockchain, and continually working with other "Founding Members" toward uniting the world in quicker, safer, and lower cost to transfer and utilize this global currency. They also created, "Calibra, a regulated subsidiary, to ensure separation between social and financial data and to build and operate services on its behalf on top of the Libra network" ([Libra White Paper](https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/#introducing-libra), page 4). The  founding members of the Libra Association currently include businesses, nonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions, all from geographically diverse locations, in addition to Facebook. This association will be responsible for final decision-making, and it has also been stated in the Libra White Paper, that the association is working to grow to "around 100 geographically distributed and diverse members, all serving as the initial validator nodes of the Libra Blockchain." 
    


* How is the project funded? How much funding have they received?
    * The key difference between the two cryptorcurrencies, Libra and Bitcoin, lies in how they derive their value. The Libra is backed by a reserve of real assets, a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks. It was also noted on page 7 of the Libra White Paper that, "...the reserve assets are
    being chosen to minimize volatility, so holders of Libra can trust the currency’s ability to preserve value over time. The assets in the Libra Reserve will be held by a geographically distributed network of custodians with
    investment-grade credit rating to provide both security and decentralization of the assets."



## __BUSINESS ACTIVITIES__

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    - **"Libra’s mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people."** This mission statement found in the White Paper is powerful in that it could spark a revolutionary change in our economy in a variety of ways, including but not limited to allowing the unbanked population of the world to have an opportunity to have access to cheap capital. Furthermore, a whole new sector of entities will be entering in order help faciliate the various needs that will accompany owning cryptocurrency (i.e. crypto wallets, resellers/brokers, authhorized dealers, regulators, etc). This would increases the allowance for mass utilization and acceptance of crytocurrency, as well as allowing competition to continue to evolve the infrastructure, give the open source code software accessibility. The Libra could be the gateway that the world needs to help us get in better position of the next global pandemic, or other unforseen detrimental event that has the capapbility of collapsing the economy. Once there is widespread use of digitial currency, it would be much easier for the public to accept using other forms of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, despite their lack of being backed by "real assets". We can see now that in the face of economic turmoil during a global pandemic, there is in fact value. This was  discussed in the pocast, "The Breakdown", hosted by Nathaniel Whittenmore. In the episode, 6 explanations for Crypto's Coronavirus Focus, it's explained that it's gained a different intrinsic value  seen as its been able to take softer losses amongst the stock market downturn in this fearful current economy. March 24th is the next US House committee on financial services hearing regarding central bank digital currency movement, and how Facebook may continue to play a role.

    -  Facebook has made it clear they would like to collaborate and work with regulators to ensure that this project is completed with the greater good in mind. __" We believe that collaborating and innovating with
    the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure
    that a sustainable, secure, and trusted framework underpins this new system. And this approach can deliver
    a giant leap forward toward a lower-cost, more accessible, and more connected global financial system."__ (Libra White Paper)


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    
    - Intended to have a global consumer impact, it is also discussed in the White Paper, __"Securing your financial assets on your mobile device should be simple and intuitive. Moving money around globally should be as easy and cost-effective as — and even more safe and secure than — sending a text message or sharing a photo, no matter where you live, what you do, or how much you earn. New product
    innovation and additional entrants to the ecosystem will enable the lowering of barriers to access and cost
    of capital for everyone and facilitate frictionless payments for more people."__

    - __"The assets behind Libra are the major difference between it and many       existing cryptocurrencies that lack
    such intrinsic value and hence have prices that fluctuate significantly based on expectations. Libra is indeed
    a cryptocurrency, though, and by virtue of that, it inherits several attractive properties of these new digital
    currencies: the ability to send money quickly, the security of cryptography, and the freedom to easily transmit
    funds across borders. Just as people can use their phones to message friends anywhere in the world today,
    with Libra, the same can be done with money — instantly, securely, and at low cost"__(White Paper)

    - An unfair advantage that is used by Facebook for this project is their access to a mass user base. This advantage on top of the previous misuse of data, could potentially lead to disasterous results; Zuckerberg had been told by a New York Democrat, Nydia Velázquez, who referenced Facebook's early motto to move fast and break things, saying, "Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system." (https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-controversial-libra-cryptocurrency/)

* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?__
    - Libra is made up of three parts that will work together to create a more inclusive financial system:
    
        1. It is built on a __secure,__ __scalable__, and __reliable blockchain__;
        2. It is backed by a __reserve of assets__ designed to give it intrinsic value;
        3. It is governed by the __independent Libra Association__ tasked with evolving the ecosystem.

    - "The Libra Blockchain is powered by __open-source software.__ The first implementation of the Libra protocol — the technology behind the blockchain — is Libra Core, which is an open-source project managed by the Libra Association using development practices established by the open-source community. Developing the technology behind the Libra Blockchain in this way ensures that the blockchain is accessible to everyone and that technology decisions are fair and transparent.The programming language Move will also be used to implement the Libra Blockchain." "The Libra Blockchain: Over the coming months, the association will work with the community to gather
    feedback on the Libra Blockchain prototype and bring it to a production-ready state. In particular, this work will focus on ensuring the security, performance, and scalability of the protocol and implementation.
    The Libra Association will construct well-documented APIs and libraries to enable users to interact with the Libra Blockchain. The Libra Association will create a framework for the collaborative development of the technology
    behind the Libra Blockchain using the open-source methodology. Procedures will be created for discussing and reviewing changes to the protocol and software that support the blockchain. The association will perform extensive testing of the blockchain, which range from tests of the protocol to constructing a full-scale test of the network in collaboration with entities such as wallet
    services and exchanges to ensure the system is working before launch.
    The association will work to foster the development of the Move language and determine a path for third parties to create smart contracts once language development has stabilized — after the launch of the Libra ecosystem." (White Paper)

## __LANDSCAPE:__

* What domain of the financial industry is the project in?

    - **Digital Currency**

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 

    - For the past 5 years, cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain consistent  value and gain mainstream adoption. There are different variations cryptocurrencies but they all have the same struggles to overcome in getting wide acceptance.  

    - There are now other uses for Bitcoin that is also proving to expand the industry. A natural-gas power plant in Dresden, New York, Greenidge Generation LLC, revealed the energy provider has the capacity to mine around $50,000 worth of bitcoins (5.5 BTC) every day (https://news.bitcoin.com/natural-gas-bitcoin-mining-operation/)

    - There doesn't seem to be any sign of slowdown for the cryptocurrency industry. It is powered by a persistent group of individuals, and now with the foundation of open source code allowing the ability for global financial services, the community is able to collaborate and drive the economy upward with competition.

    

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    - __Bitcoin__
    - __Ethereum__


## __RESULTS__

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    - __The government has asked for a hault to the plans back in 2019 due to too many unknown risks that needed to be examined to determine how a matter of this nature could be exploited__

    - __Could potentially allow easier,quicker, and more secure access to cheap capital, across the globe, including low-income individuals__ 

    - __Although Facebook has spearheaded the development of Libra, and will be creating the first consumer “wallet” for the currency through its Calibra subsidiary, the actual development of the service will be handed over to the Libra Association, an arms-length organisation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.__

    - __Zuckerberg, told mostly but not unanimously skeptical representatives, this project would help the world's unbanked enter the financial system. And the US needed to lead in cryptocurrencies, he said appealing to American patriotism, rather than cede the field to China.__ (https://www.cnet.com/news/heres-what-you-need-to-               know-about-facebooks-controversial-libra-cryptocurrency/)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on metrics? 

    * There has been quite a bit of controversy on the metrics that determine success for cryptocurrency. The stock market prices shows what the market values it currency out, however it should be considered that cryptocurrency is not widely understood or used, therefore when there are uncertainties towards an idea, it causes volatility. 

    * Another interesting note is the effects of the coronavirus. Yes different cryptocurrency stocks have decreased in value as the stock market is plummeting, but they are significantly stronger and some cryptos such as coinlite, are still increasing in value. This shows there must be some intrinsic value to an asset that is able to stabilize during a historical global pandemic, and should be something worth considering for future stability of the economy (The Breakdown). Although, the Libra is different in that it is actually backed by real assets, this would still be a stepping stone in getting widespread utilitization of global cryptocurrency. This pandemic exposes something that is fundamentally off about the current existing markets. It shows there is an opportunity for growth and change, necessating the conditions for a rise in the acceptance of cryptocurrency.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
    * Facebook has major advantages in performing in the cryptocurrency domain over its competitors for a number of reasons. It is already a very powerful company, that has access to millions of users, in addition to gathering some of the world's other technologically advanced companies to help spread the use of the Libra.
    * Bitcoin on the other hand, has been struggling for years to gain mass acceptance in use and perception of value. 

## __RECOMMENDATIONS__
----
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriatre for your solution?

        - MY NOTES: I AM INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC , BUT I DONT SEE IT BEING A SUSTAINBLE PLAN BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CREDIBILITY OR CLOUT THAT A TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUION OFFERS, IN ADDITION TO A HISTORY OF PRIVACY SCANDALS,THERE ARE CURRENTLY TOO MANY UNKNOWNS NOT YET SET IN PLACE THAT COULD CAUSE DISTATEROUS EFFECTS.
    
        -PROJECT OBSTACLES INCLUDE: GAINING TRUST, MAINSTREAM ACCESSIBLITY/ACCEPTANCE, REGULATION

		b. "Didn't learn much about Facebook’s audacious plan to create an association of big businesses to issue a new digital currency called Libra."
		c. "Libra skeptics have largely focused on consumer protection concerns and money-laundering vulnerabilities. While these are undoubtedly important issues, there are much broader dangers in creating a global payments system controlled by the world’s largest social media company."
		d. The fundamental problem is that, contrary to Facebook’s narrative, Libra is not simply a money transfer scheme. Once launched, Libra will spawn an entire ecosystem of financial services and service providers — authorized Libra dealers, brokers, asset managers, custodians, exchanges, digital identity providers, verifiers and so on — whose identities and qualifications we cannot yet anticipate.
		e. These entities may be controlled by Facebook or by other corporate members of Libra Association, operate across multiple financial and commercial markets and not be subject to appropriate supervision and oversight by financial regulators.
		
		f. The launch of Libra could enable a potentially significant increase in the volume and velocity of speculative activity in the financial market. Libra could quickly become a systemically important “benchmark” that would serve as the basis for creating other tradable financial instruments, such as derivatives, indexes and investment fund products. This wouldn’t merely inject more complexity, opacity and instability into the financial system — it would also create new opportunities for fraud and market manipulation on a scale likely to make the LIBOR scandal seem quaint.
		
		g. Were Libra to grow and become a truly universal means of payment, how would its sponsors ensure that there were enough safe sovereign assets, such as United States Treasury bonds, to ensure that it has liquid and stable backing?
			i. By also having assets backed by bitcoin??? Or does this contradict the concept of stable…consider the conravirus effects on the economy, and bitcoin being least affected
			
			ii. Would they lobby the United States government to issue more federal debt? Would they start manufacturing so-called synthetic assets that track the value of real government bonds, instead of actually acquiring them? This latter option brings back bad memories of the pre-2008 growth of synthetic securitizations and other high-risk structured products that contributed to the global financial crisis.
